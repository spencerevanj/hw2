pupper is a social network for connecting with dogs all over the world. Users can create accounts to post updates, photos, chat with other dogs, and even arrange puppy play dates!
Currently, users can read about our site and view some of our current users (just images and text for now until real accounts are created).
In future updates, users themselves will be able to create an account, access a "feed" with updates and images from their friends or followed accounts, and post unique content.
Finally, users can also purchase a select number of products for their dog to enjoy.
